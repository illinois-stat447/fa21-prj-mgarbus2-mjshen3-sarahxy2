# Michael Garbus, Michelle Shen, Sarah Yang

## STAT 447 - Final Group Project Peer Evaluation

### Due: Thursday, December 9th, 2021, Noon

We, Michael Garbus, Michelle Shen, and Sarah Yang all contributed equally and were responsive to help others in the team with problems encountered during the project. Michelle created the data visualizations and data wrangling table, and helped convert content for the Rmd presentation. Sarah worked with data cleaning, data grouping and categorization, and visualizations. Michael worked on the project writeup, data cleaning for the modeling and replacement, the three different predictive models, as well as converting the style and some of the content for the Rmd presentation. We all assisted with other parts in the project as well. For example, whenever one of us was struggling with a compilation error in RStudio Cloud or had issues committing updates onto Github, the other group members would jump in to provide their perspective to resolve the issue.

The slideshow was also a group effort, with each member understanding which topics to discuss and completing them with enough time to comfortably record. All of us were responsive to problems and made it to scheduled team meetings.
