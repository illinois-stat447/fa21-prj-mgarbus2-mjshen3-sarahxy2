# Summary

As college students who sometimes have to prioritize other things over health, sleep, or both, we are interested in how fitness can affect the quality of sleep. We were able to get datasets from the Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep [(STAGES)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29860441/) study which contains collected data on over 1,500 anonymized adult or adolescent patients evaluated for sleep disorders thanks to the National Sleep Research Resource [The National Sleep Research Resource](https://sleepdata.org/about). The STAGES data contained sleep polysomnography recordings (where in electrodes are attached to the body to record sleep data --- the gold standard for sleep studies), surveys done on the participants before the study, and surveys done on the participants after the study. The surveys contained fitness data and past health data which we used to determine people who were fit, and people who were good sleepers. We used this data to determine if we could predict a good sleeper from their fitness attributes using 3 machine learning techniques: XGBoost, KNN, and Elastic-Net.


# Summary & Context of Data

The data used in this project is sourced from STAGES - Stanford Technology, Analytics, and Genomics in Sleep. The STAGES study is a cross-sectional, multi-center study created to study the vital infrastructure necessary for sleep and sleep disorder research. Approximately 30,000 patients provided data at various sleep clinic sites over a period of less than 4 years. The patients in the study were recruited from clinical centers across the U.S. and Canada, and each subject spent approximately 1-3 hours completing questionnaires, neurocognitive testing, photography, and blood sampling for purposes of the study. Patients were also given an Actigraph device to wear for at least 2 weeks at home to monitor fitness activity and health metrics.

The data was gathered through surveys and in controlled environments through which implementation of protocol and training of staff were developed with standard operating procedures and quality assurance and control of data.

## Summary of Questionnaires & Surveys

We included the results of some of the surveys used in the data. Summaries of the surveys are below.

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was developed by Dr. Murray Johns in 1990, and it is a scale to assess the daytime sleepiness of his Sleep Medicine private practice patients. It is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions where respondents rate, on a 4-point scale, their likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different, common activities. The survey takes no more than 3 minutes to complete, and it is an objective measure of daytime sleepiness. The survey does not ask about subjective feelings of alertness/drowsiness, but simply how likely dozing off is. The activities listed in the ESS questionnaire are: sitting and reading, watching TV, inactively sitting in a public place (e.g. a theatre), as a passenger in a car for an hour without a break, lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit, sitting and talking to someone, and being in a car while stopped for a few minutes in traffic. Through these relatable and easily imaginable scenarios, the survey respondent would provide the likelihood of falling asleep/dozing. This is one of the predictors used to predict the qualities of a good sleeper.


In addition to using the ESS results as a predictor, the dataset also includes the use of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), which is a 9-item scale used to measure the severity of fatigue and its effect on a person's activities and lifestyle among patients with a variety of disorders. The items are scored on a 7-point scale with 7 being "strongly agree," and a higher score indicating greater fatigue and negative results from it. An example prompt would be "Fatigue is among my most disabling symptoms."


The `phq_0900` variable is the sum for Patient Health Questionnaire. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, while the total score range from 0 to 27. The score can be divided into the following categories of increasing severity: Not Clinically significant (0-4), Minimal Symptoms (5-9), Minor depression/Dysthymia/Mild Major Depression (10-14), Moderately Severe Major Depression (15-19), and Severe Major Depression (20-27) [Kroenke K et al. 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495268/). We created a categorical variable divided based off of those who received a Mild/Major Depression score and above, and those who did not. 


The `gad_0800` variable is the sum of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7). A score of above 10 means that the patient has severe anxiety, or at least must be recommended for further evaluation [Spitzer R et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16717171/). We created a categorical based off of the score being above 10.

# Data Wrangling

```{r}
fitness_data_table <- as.data.table(fitness_data)
```

```{r}
fitness_data_table[, .(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time, na.rm = TRUE), 
                       count = length(sleep_time)), by = good_sleeper]
```

From our classifications of a good sleeper, a good sleeper will have, on average, 117 minutes more sleep than that of a poorer sleeper.

```{r}
fitness_data_table[, .(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time, na.rm = TRUE), count = length(sleep_time)), 
                   by = compared_usual_feel_upon_awakening][order(avg_sleep_time)]
```

From this result of average sleep time among surveyed participants, we can oddly see that those who felt more rested than usual slept for less time (in minutes) than other categories. We speculate that those participants felt more rested because they did not enter deep sleep for as long as others, or simply woke up during an optimal point during the REM cycle and did not feel groggy. Or perhaps those that feel more_rested during this study just did not get adequate sleep prior to participating, and some factors during the survey period allowed them to sleep more soundly. Because the feeling upon awakening is subjective relative to each participant, we do not have a concrete, quantitative reason behind the correlation.

```{r}
fitness_data_table[, .(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time, na.rm = TRUE), 
                       median_sleep_time = median(sleep_time, na.rm = TRUE), 
                       count = length(sleep_time)), 
                   by = list(nose_0300, nose_0500)][order(-avg_sleep_time)]
```

From this output, we can see that a person without the breathing/sinus issues in question has a higher average sleep time than those who do have one or both breathing issues. Interestingly, a person with trouble breathing (nose_0300) has a higher median sleep time than one without breathing issues by about 1 minute. Although this difference is noticeable, it is most likely not significant.

```{r}
fitness_data_table[, .(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time, na.rm = TRUE), count = length(sleep_time)), 
                   by = list(gad_0800, good_sleeper, dem_0500)][order(-avg_sleep_time)]
```

Here is an output of average sleep times grouped by whether we classified them as a good sleeper, their gender, and whether they are diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder from the questionnaire. A general trend here is that a participant with a general anxiety disorder will tend to sleep longer, and men will tend to sleep longer than women as well. One thing to notice is that, of the top six average sleep times, five of them were categorized as good sleepers except for 89 women (third row of output). Despite not being categorized as a good sleeper, they had the third highest average sleep time.


# Visualizations

```{r}
  ggplot(fitness_data, aes(x = age, y = sleep_time)) +
    geom_point(aes(color=compared_usual_feel_upon_awakening)) +
    #geom_vline(xintercept = 4500) +
    #geom_hline(yintercept = 45) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula=y~x) +
    ggtitle("Sleep Time versus Age and Feeling upon Awakening", 
            subtitle = "With Trend-line for Parameter Relationship") +
    xlab("Age (Years)") +
    ylab("Sleep Time (Minutes)")
```

From this colored scatterplot with a line of best fit, we find a general trend that average sleep time among patients will decrease as they grow older in age. We can also see that the scatterplot has greater density of points near the higher sleep times, with a thinner distribution of points among the lower sleep times (250 minutes or less). It is difficult to see a clear difference between less_rested, more_rested, and same feelings of well-restedness from this plot, so we will create another visualization to focus on that.

```{r}
    ggplot(data=na.omit(fitness_data),
        mapping=aes(x=age, y=sleep_time)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula=y~x, colour="black", se=FALSE) + 
    geom_smooth(aes(color=compared_usual_feel_upon_awakening), 
                method = "lm", formula=y~x, se = FALSE) +
    xlab("Age (Years)") +
    ylab("Sleep Time (Minutes)")
```

From this second scatterplot, this time with three lines of best fit based on the groupings of feeling upon awakening, we see that the scatterplot creates a visualization of the conclustion seen from the data wrangling table. Those who felt the "same" upon awakening tended to sleep for a longer average time than those that felt less rested or more rested. Something new we can see from the visualization is that, between less_rested and more_rested groups, the difference among sleep_time is more drastic among younger ages. However, near ages ~80, there is not quite a difference in prediction of average sleep times between the less_rested and more_rested groups. We believe this occurred due to lack of enough observations from the elderly age group, leading to those points at age 80 to be higher leverage points.


```{r}
  ggplot(data=na.omit(fitness_data),
         mapping=aes(x=bmi,y=sleep_time)) + 
	    facet_wrap(~ compared_usual_feel_upon_awakening, nrow = 1) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula=y~x, colour="blue", se=FALSE) +
    xlab("Body Mass Index") +
    ylab("Sleep Time (Minutes))")
```

Next is a facet_wrap visualization broken up by feelings of restedness upon awakening, with Body Mass Index among the x-axis. From our understanding, people with a Body between 18.4 and 25.9 are generally considered of healthy BMI. Values under the range are typically classified as underweight, and value over the range are classified as overweight or obese, depending on extremity. Our theory was that people within the healthy BMI range would be considered healthy, and there existed a correlation between health and average sleep time. We can see from these plots that those in the more_rested category have a far more extreme negative relationship between BMI and Sleep Time, compared to those that felt the same or less_rested upon awakening. There could be a correlation between BMI, feelings of well-restedness, and sleep time.


```{r}
	ggplot(fitness_data, aes(x=sleep_time, 
	                         fill = awakenings_compared_to_usual)) + 
	    geom_histogram(bins = 30, freq = T) +
	    facet_wrap( ~ awakenings_compared_to_usual) +
	    labs(title = "Awakenings Compared to Usual vs. Sleep Time")
```

From this set of histograms, we compare the distribution of sleep times against a subjective number of awakenings compared to the usual. We can see that the fewest number of participants woke up less during the study than usual, and most participants woke up the same number of times during the night. From two of the three distributions, we can see a slightly bimodal distribution of sleep times, with a peak near 125 minutes and then around the group average (a value between 300-400 minutes).


```{r}
plot(density(fitness_data[fitness_data$dem_0500 == "M",]$sleep_time), 
     col = 'blue', main = "Sleep Time by Participant's Sex")
lines(density(fitness_data[fitness_data$dem_0500 == "F",]$sleep_time), 
      col = "red")
```

For our last visualization, we created a density plot to analyze the proportion of sleepers receiving minutes of sleep, and it was categorized by the patient's sex, whether they were Male or Female. We can see that a greater proportion of women than men slept between 300-500 minutes, and the men's distribution would have a slightly greater standard deviation in sleep minutes than the women's, with a greater proportion of men sleeping far too little hours.

# Modeling

We selected our models based off of prediction accuracy. Because of this, there may be some low values in the sensitivity and specificity.

## Extreme Gradient Boosted Tree (XGBoost)

The first model we attempted was an extreme gradient boosted tree model. A boosted tree is a decision tree that achieves a high modelling accuracy by training new models to account for the training data that was previously incorrectly modeled.  

```{r, message = FALSE}

According to our XGB model, `dem_0800`, `ess_0900`, and `bmi` are the predictors that provided the most gain to the model. It has an accuracy of `r (118 + 162) / (247 + 48 + 105 + 64) * 100`$\%$, a specificity (true negative classification) of `r (118)/(118 + 107 +87) * 100`$\%$, and a sensitivity (true positive classification) of `r (162)/(162 + 87 + 107)* 100`$\%$.

## KNN

The second model we used was KNN, which searches for the closest k neighbors to an observation for classification.

```{r}
library(kknn)
library(caret)
library(class)
control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 3)
knn.cvfit <- train(y ~ ., method = "knn", 
                     data = data.frame("x" = train, "y" = as.factor(train_y)),
                     tuneGrid = data.frame(k =c(5,10,33,50)),
                     trControl = control)
knn.cvfit

testpred = knn(train = train, test = test, cl = as.factor(train_y), k = 50)
table(testpred, as.factor(test_y))
```
After considering a tuning grid of multiple K's and controlling using repeated cross validation, we discovered that `k = 33` was the correct amount of neighbors to consider.
Unfortunately, we are unable to determine feature importance from this model. It had an accuracy of `r (151 + 124)/(312 + 145 + 17) * 100`$\%$, a sensitivity of `r (124/(124 + 125 + 74))*100`$\%$, and a specificity of `r 151/(151+125+74)* 100`$\%$.

## Elastic-Net Model

We next used an elastic-net model, which combines the strengths of the Ridge model, which is able to shrink down the coefficients of parameters to make them insignificant, and the LASSO model, which is able to completely remove parameters from the model.

```{r}
#Logistic Regression model 
library(glmnet)

library(caret)
train <- train
train[,c('nose_0300', 'nose_0500', 'phq_1000', 'fss_1000', 'gad_0800', 
         'diet_0700', 'famhx_0700', 'narc_1600', 
         'soclhx_1500', 'diet_0340')] <- lapply((train[,c('nose_0300', 'nose_0500', 
                                                          'phq_1000', 'fss_1000', 'gad_0800', 
                                                          'diet_0700', 'famhx_0700', 
                                                          'narc_1600', 'soclhx_1500', 
                                                          'diet_0340')]),factor)

test[,c('nose_0300', 'nose_0500', 'phq_1000', 'fss_1000',
        'gad_0800', 'diet_0700', 'famhx_0700', 'narc_1600',
        'soclhx_1500', 'diet_0340')] <- lapply((test[,c('nose_0300', 'nose_0500',
                                                        'phq_1000', 'fss_1000', 'gad_0800',
                                                        'diet_0700', 'famhx_0700', 'narc_1600',
                                                        'soclhx_1500', 'diet_0340')]), factor)
train_y <- as.factor(train_y)
test_y <- as.factor(test_y)
train <- data.matrix(train)
test <- data.matrix(test)


library(glmnet)
glm_model <- glmnet(x = train, y = train_y, family = "binomial", alpha = 0.5)
lowest_lambda <- min(glm_model$lambda)
glm_predict <- predict(glm_model, test, s = lowest_lambda, type = "class")
table(glm_predict, test_y)
coef(glm_model, lowest_lambda)
(141 + 144)/((141 + 144) + (81 + 108))
```
It appears that the most significant health predictors of a good sleeper is the score on the `narc_1600`, the `fss_1000`, `soclhx_0900 `, and `nose_0300`. Interestingly, BMI use does not appear to have a correlation with sleep, at least according to our data and our elastic-net model. It has an accuracy of `r (141 + 144)/((141 + 144) + (81 + 108)) * 100`$\%$, a specificity (true negative classification) of `r (144)/(144 + 108 + 81) * 100`$\%$, and a sensitivity (true positive classification), at around `r (141/(141 + 108 + 81)) * 100`$\%$
